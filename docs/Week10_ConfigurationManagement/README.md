## What is Ansible?
- Ansible is an open-source, configuration management tool to **provision IT environments**, **deploy software** or be integrated to **CI/CD** pipelines.
- Ansible helps improve the scalability, consistency and reliability of your IT environment
- Ansible can automate repetitive system administration tasks

## What can Ansible automate?
- **Provisioning**: Set up various servers (e.g Nginx web server) you need in your infrastructure
- **Configuration management**: Changes the configuration of an application, OS, or device; start and stop services; install or update applications; implement a security policy; or perform a wide variety of other configuration tasks.
- **Application deployment**: Make **DevOps** easier by automating the deployment of internally developed applications to your production systems.

## Why Ansible?
- Simplicity 
- Ansible uses **YAML**, a simple configuration language rather than **Ruby** which Puppet and Chef use.
- Ansible deployment is also agentless, meaning instead of installing an agent on every system you want to manage, Ansible just requires that systems have **Python (on Linux servers)** or **PowerShell (on Window servers) and SSH**
