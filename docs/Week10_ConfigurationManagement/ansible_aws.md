## AWS Route 53
Performs the following main functions:\
- **Domain registration** - Amazon Route 53 lets you register domain names, such as **example.com**
- **DNS Service** - Amazon Route 53 translates friendly names
- **Health Checking** - Amazon Route 53 sends automated requests over the Internet to
- Called Route 53 which takes its name with reference to Port 53, which handles DNS for both the TCP

## Load Balancing in AWS
- Load balancing efficiently distributes incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also know as *server farm* or *server pool*.
- AWS Elastic Load Balancing
- Nginx

## What does scalability mean in Cloud Computing?
- The ability manage the capacity of your environment
- The ability to size up or down
- Traditionally, businesses were tied to physical constraints, such as hard-drive space and memory, all of which impede scalability.
- In cloud computing, these constrains are replaced by an infrastructure that can scale up or down

## How does AWS support scalability 
- AWS provides an auto scaling service and monitors your applications, therefore automatically adjusting the capacity while maintaining a steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost
- AWS automatically adds or removes EC2 instances according to conditions you define
- The AWS EC2 Auto Scaling service adopts dynamic and predictive scaling features to add or remove EC2 instances.

## AWS Monitoring and Optimisation Tools
### SolarWinds AppOptics 
- Designed to expand on the metrics you already monitor with Cloudwatch.
- Keeps track of virtual capacity limitations
- Data log trends
- Performance statistics 

### Amazon CloudWatch 
- Monitoring and observability service
- CloudWatch does the following:
    - Respond to system-wide performance changes 
    - Optimise resource utilisation 
    - Get a unified view of operational health 
    - Detects anomalous behaviour
    

## AWS Auto Scaling work?
- They detect impaired Amazon EC2 instances and unhealthy applications 
- They replace instances without your invention
- They


## Load balancing and scalability

## Scaling out 
- spinning up another server


## scaling up
- making a replica (instance)
