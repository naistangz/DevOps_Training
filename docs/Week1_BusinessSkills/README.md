## What is agile?
- Agile software development is an iterative methodology
- It is an approach that breaks down larger projects into small, manageable chunks called iterations
- At the end of each iteration (which takes place over consistent time interval) something of value is produced.
- Instead of in-depth planning at the beginning of the project, agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time
- Encourages constant feedback from the end users
- Cross-functional teams work on iterations of a product over a period of time
    - This **work** is organised into a backlog that is prioritised based on business or customer value
- The goal of each iteration is to produce a working product. 
- All about delivering the product incrementally and iteratively, iteratively meaning refining the product each time.
- Customer is getting value at the end of every sprint, and about the team learning about the product, understanding more about what your customer wants.

## The four values of the Agile Manifesto 
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
    - Continuous development
    - Build feedback loop with your customers so that you can constantly ensure that your product works for them.
    - Using pareto law, only 20% of the product's features are often or always used, so working in agile, this 20% is the most valuable part of the highest priority featured delivery (e.g Microsoft word, you'll maybe use spellcheck, print, copy or paste but never use mailmerge or hundreds of language packs)
    - Development team should work on highest priority features and move their way down to lower priority features until the whole product is complete.
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - People are more important that using the best tools
    - Communication is key  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation 
    - Be customer centric rather than focus on documentation
- Responding to change over following a plan.
    - Flexible road-map
    - Software team should have the ability to pivot and change direction whenever they need to, with a flexible road map 


## **12 Principles of Agile Methodology**
Agile manifesto lists [12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). 
1. Highest priority: satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from weeks to months, with preference to shorter timescale. 
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
6. Most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face. 
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
10. Simplicity - Maximising amount of work not done
11. Good architecture, requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
12. Team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts its behaviour accordingly. 

## Advantages of Agile
- **Change is embraced:**
   - Shorter planning cycles
   - Easy to accommodate and accept changes at any time during the project
   - Always an opportunity to refine and reprioritise the backlog
   
- **End-goal can be unknown:**
    - Agile is beneficial for projects where end-goal is not clearly defined
    - As project progresses, goals will come to light and development can easily adapt to these evolving requirements. 

- **Faster, high-quality delivery:**
    - Breaking down project into iterations (manageable units) allows the team to focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration. 
    - Frequent tests during each iteration
    - Bugs get identified and solved more quickly
    
- **Strong team interaction:**
    - Agile highlights the importance of frequent communication and face-to-face interactions
    - Teams work together and people are able to take responsibility and own parts of the projects
         
- **Customer-centric:**
    - Customers can see the work being delivered, share their input and have a real impact on the end product.
    - Customers gain sense of ownership by working closely with project team.

- **Continuous improvement:**
    - Agile projects encourage feedback from users, team members throughout whole project.
    - Lessons learned are used to improve future iterations. 

- **Speed to market**
    - Agile lets you get your concepts to users as quickly as possible 
    - During every sprint an agile project delivers something of value
    - At any point, you may determine you want to launch what has been delivered and start building a user base or testing your hypothesis.

## Disadvantages of Agile
- **Planning is less concrete:**
    - Hard to pin down solid delivery date. 
    - Agile is based on time-boxed delivery and project managers are often reprioritising tasks
    - Items originally scheduled for delivery may not be complete in time. 
    - Additional sprints can be added at any time in the project, adding to overall timeline. 
    
- **Final product can be different:**
    - Initial agile project might not have a definitive plan, so the final product can look much different than what was initially intended.
    - Agile is so flexible, new iterations may be added based on evolving customer feedback, which can lead to different final deliverable. 

## Agile Challenges
- Biggest challenge is underestimating how radical this transformation can be.
- If current team is doing the same tasks with more agile-sounding names, there is not a significant change.
- Teams need to step away from long term detailed plans, instead inspect and adapt in smaller iterations.
- Embrace uncertainty
- E.g if you're a manager, you have to change the way you receive status updates. You might be used to a one-page weekly status report. It shows it your project is on-time and under-budget whereas agile doesn't communicate with reports, instead the team communicates with working software.
    - This means that you'll attend frequent sprint reviews and give direct feedback about the product
- Difficult to avoid group think. Agile is about distributing expertise to everyone in the team.
- Everyone should always be teaching and learning.
- Typically, there'll be an expert whose opinion has much more weight, so a database developer might let everyone know what they're doing with the database. But when that happens, it gets really difficult for a team to have a shared understanding about the product, causing group think.
    - Group think is when experts make a convincing argument and rest of the team follow along.
    - Agile should avoid group think because everyone should be able to ask challenging questions about the product.
    - A tester should be able to ask a database developer about their design of the database, vice versa.
    - This is key part of being a self-organised team.

# Scrum
- Most popular agile framework
- Agile is mindset, Scrum is a way to embrace that mindset
    - E.g staying physically fit, there are different way to stay fit like jogging, swimming or cycling.
- Scrum is an empirical process control framework meaning Scrum embraces experimental approach to improve the product so they inspect and adapt if they need to make changes.
- A scrum team might learn something new and then work with customer to quickly improve the product.
- Popular because it's lightweight (simple to understand)
- Scrum team only has **3** roles, **5** events and **3** artifacts

## Burndown Chart
- Graphical representation of work left to do versus time
- Used in Scrum
- Contains measurable progress over time
- Outstanding work vertical axis, with time along horizontal
- Useful for predicting when all work will be completed
- In daily scrum, the dev team updates the sprint burn down and plots the remaining work of the day
- Useful for monitoring the project scope, keep team running on schedule, comparing planned work against progression.

## Information Radiators
- AKA BVC (Big Visible Chart)
- Large graphical representation of project information
- Can include most type of charts e.g. Burndown charts, task boards (kanban)
- Purpose of information radiators is to maintain transparency, help team focus on what really needs their attention

## Scrum Roles
### Project Manager
- Point person for the project
- People in the organisation will come to them for status updates

### Scrum Master
- Not about mastering the team, but mastering scrum
- They are not managers, but closer to being a trainer or a coach.
- Make sure developers understand scrum and admin tasks like making sure everyone has a chair in shared workspace.
- Role changes. They may start out spending most of their time like showing product owner how to write better [user stories](#user-story), over time, scrum master can spend time on administration
- No authority, encouraging team to taken on greater responsibilities
- Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organise
- Instead of being a manager, you encourage the team to self-manage.

### Product Owner
- Responsible for setting direction, prioritising the work
- Works with the team to deliver the product
- Shared responsibility between product owner and development team
- Works off a [product backlog](#scrum-artefacts)
- Fully integrated into team. They sit with team and tell team if the product should have a checkbox or radio dial.

### Product Manager
- Long-term strategy for a product
- Create budget and look at competing products
- Once they have a vision, they'll bring in a product owner to own the product.

## Scrum Artefacts
- [x]Product Backlog
    - A ranked list of features that product owner would like included in product.
    - Teams will put [user stories](#user-story) in the product backlog
    -
- [x]Sprint Backlog
- [x]Product Increment

## Scrum Events
- 

# Kanban
- A scheduling system used in [lean](#lean-start-up) manufacturing
- Agile teams display work on a Kanban board
- Kanban system is popular way to apply lean thinking to software development
- Lean thinking is about focusing on what's valuable to the customer, and continuously improving the product over time **(which is first principle in [Agile Manifesto](#the-four-values-of-the-agile-manifesto))**
- Agile teams focus on continuous delivery of valuable software
- A kanban board is a swim lane diagram with four or more columns:
    - Columns display labels Stories, To Do, Doing, and Done
    - Scrum teams call this task board
- Kanban is more than task board, it's a way to organise your work so that your team is focused on delivering the greatest value.
- Stories at the top should have highest customer value.

# Agile vs Scrum vs Waterfall vs Kanban
- Scrum is **not** a methodology. 
- Scrum is a framework 
- Scrum falls under agile 
- Scrum is an iterative software model that follows a set of roles, responsibilities and meetings that never change
- Scrum is an **Agile** process to focus on delivering business value in the shortest time
- Scrum promotes accountability, teamwork and function in an iterative and incremental approach. 
- Time frame for each built which are released into production are denoted as a sprint in a Scrum system
- Scrum has two mandatory roles: **Product Owner** and **Scrum Master.**

**Waterfall:**
- **Not** agile. Follows sequential, linear process
- Sometimes called a Gantt chart, a type of bar chart that shows the start and end dates for each task
- Once one of the eight stages are complete, the development team moves onto the next step. 
- The team cannot go back to a previous stage without starting the whole process from the beginning. 
- Before the team can move to next stage, requirements may be reviewed and approved by the customer.
- Changes can't be easily accommodated like agile, once the team completes a phase, they cannot go back. 
- Software is not delivered until late, the project has to complete two to four phases before coding actually begins, as a result, stakeholders do not see working software until late in lifecycle. 
- Waterfall projects usually include defined requirements in advance (in agile they evolve).

Unlike waterfall, which is strictly sequenced, you do not start design until research is done and you don't start development until the designs are signed off. Agile has designers, developers and business people working together simultaneously

**Kanban:**
- Derives from the japanese word signboard or billboard 看板
- Visual way to implement agile
- Kanban is a method or tool not a philosophy (agile)
- Kanban advocates for continuous flow, while agile works in iterations
- Kanban requires visual representation of workflow 
- Visualises workflow and full transparency of work, allowing every team member to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

# Agile vs DevOps
- DevOps is agile applied beyond software team
- Agile processes harnesses change for the customers, embracing 
- DevOps is about Ops who think like devs, Devs who think like Ops
- Emphasises the performance of the entire system, not just on the performance of a specific task or department
- Creating feedback loops, so corrections can be made
- Creating a culture that fosters continual experimentation, taking risks and understanding that repetition and practice is prerequisite to mastery.

**Difference 1: Process:**

Features|DevOps|Agile
---|---|---
Processes/practices|Communication is between dev and IT operations. Involves set of technical processes e.g. Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing|Communication between teams and customers is constant. Involves set of practices e.g scrum and kanban
Key Focus Area|Timeliness and quality have equal priority|Timeliness is the main priority
Release Cycles/Development Sprints|Smaller Release cycles with immediate feedback|Smaller release cycles
Source of feedback|Feedback is from self e.g monitoring tools|Feedback is from customers
Scope of work|Agility and need for automation|Agility only

## Why is DevOps Better than Agile?
- Agile software development is about following best practices for creating quality software in a timely manner, main problem == involves people working in silos.
- By silos, people are working in individual roles from Developers, Testers or Operations with very little communication.
- Even with communication tools like slack or teams, Agile does not emphasise the collaboration between the divisions so between them, they are not aware of what others are working on.
- This can result in the blame game when software fails or has major flaws.
- DevOps breaks these silos, and reinforces the idea of testing as equal importance to delivering in a timely manner.
- Devs thinking like Ops and Ops thinking like Devs which brings about DevOps Engineer who have a holistic view of everything: developing the code, testing that code and deploying the code.
- DevOps offers challenges in all facets of IT, communication and business. 


# Dev vs IT Operations
**IT:**
- [x]Network Infrastructure
- [x]Server and Device Management
- [x]Computer Operations and Help Desk
- [x]Vendor and contract management

**Dev:**\


# Lean Start up
- Eliminating unnecessary meetings, tasks and documentation
- Eliminating inefficient methods of working, such as multitasking
- Places strong emphasis on **the system**, i.e. the way the team works as a whole
- Lean methodology states that every process should be continuously inspected and adapted in order to improve it. 
- Method is focused on continuous improvement, kaizen 改善

# Lean vs Agile
- Both methodologies, the people - the workers - who perform the tasks are more important than the tools they use. 
- Nothing is more important than the final result. Result must create value for the customer and is the only goal of the development process.
- Agile methodology allows the client to constantly adapt his needs
- Lean provides for the manufacture of the product so that there is no waste.
- Agile concerns the optimisation of a development process
- Lean concerns the optimisation of a production process.

# Definition of *done*
- **Definition of Done** is a list of requirements that must be satisfied for all user stories. These are set at the start of the project and rarely change.
- **Acceptance criteria** (or user story acceptance criteria), however, are particular to each feature being developed. They are set at the start of a sprint and may change as development progresses and more is discovered about that feature. 

Example of each:
- **Definition of Done**: No critical and High defect will be accepted: code coverage percentage to be at least 70%; all web pages to load in under 2 seconds
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The password must be no less than 8 and no greater than 12 characters, contain at least one Uppercase letter

Acceptance Criteria| Definition of Done
------|-------
A user cannot submit a form without completing all the mandatory fields | Code Builds without error warning
Information from the form is stored in the registrations database | Code is Unit Test
Payment can be made via credit card| Code is deployed to system test environment and passed system tests
An acknowledgement email is sent to the user after submitting the form | Build pushed to demo server
DoD is macro, Acceptance Criteria is micro | Remaining hours of the User Story are marked zero

## Building a house 
**DoD:** 
- Must have four outer walls of brick
- Must have a sloped, tiled roof
- Must have a secure front door
- Must have four windows 
- Must be wind and watertight
- Must be wired for electricity
- Must be plumbed in 

**Acceptance Criteria**
- The front door must be mahogany, and be painted blue 
- Front door must be a Yale platinum 3 star (maximum security level) lock.
- The window frames must also be mahogany.
- The electrical sockets must also be fitted with CAT-5 computer network ports.
- The bathroom must have a bath and shower

This list is very specific. These details do not need to be gathered until just before the house is built. Not every house needs to be built to these exact specifications.
This is the **acceptance criteria** only for this particular house. 

## Epic Story
- One big piece of product functionality which is too large to be completed in one go or one sprint.
- An epic can be a registration, authorisation, authentification, user profile etc.
- The functionality of a product is decomposed into epics in order to estimate the time and budget for a project, organise the work of a coding team and identify the chunks of the highest priority.
 
## User Story
- User stories are specific tasks within an epic
- An epic story could creating a Registration and Authentification page.
- So user story would be looking into sign up, log in, forgot password, log out functionalities.
- Having user stories help break down an epic story and make work more efficient.
- Breaking down epic in user stories help determine estimation and the number of hours it takes to complete.

Discussing a project in terms of epic and user story has two main purposes:\
1. More convenient to discuss a product on different levels (i.e. stakeholders - product owner, coding team)
2. Helps optimise the development process.
