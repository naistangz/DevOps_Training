# Agile Methodologies

## What is agile?
- Agile software development is an iterative methodology
- It is an approach that breaks down larger projects into small, manageable chunks called iterations
- At the end of each iteration (which takes place over consistent time interval) something of value is produced.
- Instead of in-depth planning at the beginning of the project, agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time
- Encourages constant feedback from the end users
- Cross-functional teams work on iterations of a product over a period of time
    - This **work** is organised into a backlog that is prioritised based on business or customer value
- The goal of each iteration is to produce a working product. 

## The four values of the Agile Manifesto 
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - People are more important that using the best tools
    - Communication is key  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation 
    - Be customer centric rather than focus on documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - Continuous development
    - Build feedback loop with your customers so that you can constantly ensure that your product works for them.
- Responding to change over following a plan.
    - Flexible road-map
    - Software team should have the ability to pivot and change direction whenever they need to, with a flexible road map 


## **12 Principles of Agile Methodology**
Agile manifesto lists [12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). 
1. Highest priority: satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from weeks to months, with preference to shorter timescale. 
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
6. Most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face. 
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
10. Simplicity - Maximising amount of work not done
11. Good architecture, requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
12. Team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts its behaviour accordingly. 

## Advantages of Agile
- **Change is embraced:**
   - Shorter planning cycles
   - Easy to accommodate and accept changes at any time during the project
   - Always an opportunity to refine and reprioritise the backlog
   
- **End-goal can be unknown:**
    - Agile is beneficial for projects where end-goal is not clearly defined
    - As project progresses, goals will come to light and development can easily adapt to these evolving requirements. 

- **Faster, high-quality delivery:**
    - Breaking down project into iterations (manageable units) allows the team to focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration. 
    - Frequent tests during each iteration
    - Bugs get identified and solved more quickly
    
- **Strong team interaction:**
    - Agile highlights the importance of frequent communication and face-to-face interactions
    - Teams work together and people are able to take responsibility and own parts of the projects
         
- **Customer-centric:**
    - Customers can see the work being delivered, share their input and have a real impact on the end product.
    - Customers gain sense of ownership by working closely with project team.

- **Continuous improvement:**
    - Agile projects encourage feedback from users, team members throughout whole project.
    - Lessons learned are used to improve future iterations. 

- **Speed to market**
    - Agile lets you get your concepts to users as quickly as possible 
    - During every sprint an agile project delivers something of value
    - At any point, you may determine you want to launch what has been delivered and start building a user base or testing your hypothesis.

## Disadvantages of Agile
- **Planning is less concrete:**
    - Hard to pin down solid delivery date. 
    - Agile is based on time-boxed delivery and project managers are often reprioritising tasks
    - Items originally scheduled for delivery may not be complete in time. 
    - Additional sprints can be added at any time in the project, adding to overall timeline. 
    
- **Final product can be different:**
    - Initial agile project might not have a definitive plan, so the final product can look much different than what was initially intended.
    - Agile is so flexible, new iterations may be added based on evolving customer feedback, which can lead to different final deliverable. 
   
# Agile vs Scrum vs Waterfall vs Kanban
- Scrum is **not** a methodology. 
- Scrum is a framework 
- Scrum falls under agile 
- Scrum is an iterative software model that follows a set of roles, responsibilities and meetings that never change
- Scrum is an **Agile** process to focus on delivering business value in the shortest time
- Scrum promotes accountability, teamwork and function in an iterative and incremental approach. 
- Time frame for each built which are released into production are denoted as a sprint in a Scrum system
- Scrum has two mandatory roles: **Product Owner** and **Scrum Master.**

**Waterfall:**
- **Not** agile. Follows sequential, linear process
- Sometimes called a Gantt chart, a type of bar chart that shows the start and end dates for each task
- Once one of the eight stages are complete, the development team moves onto the next step. 
- The team cannot go back to a previous stage without starting the whole process from the beginning. 
- Before the team can move to next stage, requirements may be reviewed and approved by the customer.
- Changes can't be easily accommodated like agile, once the team completes a phase, they cannot go back. 
- Software is not delivered until late, the project has to complete two to four phases before coding actually begins, as a result, stakeholders do not see working software until late in lifecycle. 
- Waterfall projects usually include defined requirements in advance (in agile they evolve).

Unlike waterfall, which is strictly sequenced, you do not start design until research is done and you don't start development until the designs are signed off. Agile has designers, developers and business people working together simultaneously

**Kanban:**
- Derives from the japanese word signboard or billboard 看板
- Visual way to implement agile
- Kanban is a method or tool not a philosophy (agile)
- Kanban advocates for continuous flow, while agile works in iterations
- Kanban requires visual representation of workflow 
- Visualises workflow and full transparency of work, allowing every team member to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

# Lean Start up
- Eliminating unnecessary meetings, tasks and documentation
- Eliminating inefficient methods of working, such as multitasking
- Places strong emphasis on **the system**, i.e. the way the team works as a whole
- Lean methodology states that every process should be continuously inspected and adapted in order to improve it. 
- Method is focused on continuous improvement, kaizen 改善

# Lean vs Agile
- Both methodologies, the people - the workers - who perform the tasks are more important than the tools they use. 
- Nothing is more important than the final result. Result must create value for the customer and is the only goal of the development process.
- Agile methodology allows the client to constantly adapt his needs
- Lean provides for the manufacture of the product so that there is no waste.
- Agile concerns the optimisation of a development process
- Lean concerns the optimisation of a production process.

# Definition of *done*
- **Definition of Done** is a list of requirements that must be satisfied for all user stories. These are set at the start of the project and rarely change.
- **Acceptance criteria** (or user story acceptance criteria), however, are particular to each feature being developed. They are set at the start of a sprint and may change as development progresses and more is discovered about that feature. 

Example of each:
- **Definition of Done**: No critical and High defect will be accepted: code coverage percentage to be at least 70%; all web pages to load in under 2 seconds
- **Acceptance Criteria:** The password must be no less than 8 and no greater than 12 characters, contain at least one Uppercase letter

Acceptance Criteria| Definition of Done
------|-------
A user cannot submit a form without completing all the mandatory fields | Code Builds without error warning
Information from the form is stored in the registrations database | Code is Unit Test
Payment can be made via credit card| Code is deployed to system test environment and passed system tests
An acknowledgement email is sent to the user after submitting the form | Build pushed to demo server
DoD is macro, Acceptance Criteria is micro | Remaining hours of the User Story are marked zero

## Building a house 
**DoD:** 
- Must have four outer walls of brick
- Must have a sloped, tiled roof
- Must have a secure front door
- Must have four windows 
- Must be wind and watertight
- Must be wired for electricity
- Must be plumbed in 

**Acceptance Criteria**
- The front door must be mahogany, and be painted blue 
- Front door must be a Yale platinum 3 star (maximum security level) lock.
- The window frames must also be mahogany.
- The electrical sockets must also be fitted with CAT-5 computer network ports.
- The bathroom must have a bath and shower

This list is very specific. These details do not need to be gathered until just before the house is built. Not every house needs to be built to these exact specifications.
This is the **acceptance criteria** only for this particular house.
