# Agile Methodologies

## What is agile?
- Agile software development is an iterative methodology 
- Instead of in-depth planning at the beginning of the project, agile methodologies are open to changing requirements over time
- Encourages constant feedback from the end users
- Cross-functional teams work on iterations of a product over a period of time
    - This **work** is organised into a backlog that is prioritised based on business or customer value
- The goal of each iteration is to produce a working product. 

## **12 Principles of Agile Methodology**
Agile manifesto lists [12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). 
1. Highest priority: satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from weeks to months, with preference to shorter timescale. 
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. 
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. 
6. Most efficient and effective method of conveying information is face-to-face. 
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. Sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. 
10. Simplicity - Maximising amount of work not done
11. Good architecture, requirements and designs emerge from self-organising teams.
12. Team reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts its behaviour accordingly. 

## Advantages of Agile
- **Change is embraced:**
   - Shorter planning cycles
   - Easy to accommodate and accept changes at any time during the project
   - Always an opportunity to refine and reprioritise the backlog
   
- **End-goal can be unknown:**
    - Agile is beneficial for projects where end-goal is not clearly defined
    - As project progresses, goals will come to light and development can easily adapt to these evolving requirements. 

- **Faster, high-quality delivery:**
    - Breaking down project into iterations (manageable units) allows the team to focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration. 
    - Frequent tests during each iteration
    - Bugs get identified and solved more quickly
    
- **Strong team interaction:**
    - Agile highlights the importance of frequent communication and face-to-face interactions
    - Teams work together and people are able to take responsibility and own parts of the projects
         
- **Customer-centric:**
    - Customers can see the work being delivered, share their input and have a real impact on the end product.
    - Customers gain sense of ownership by working closely with project team.

- **Continuous improvement:**
    - Agile projects encourage feedback from users, team members throughout whole project.
    - Lessons learned are used to improve future iterations.
