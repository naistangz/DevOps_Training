1. Why do you want to work in DevOps?
- 3 main aspects:
    **Technical benefits:**
    - DevOps requires development and operations teams to collaborate and this requires understanding of what software developers do, what operations team do. And when you combine the knowledge of both teams, I can create an impact because greater collaboration translates to shorter development cycles time, increasing frequency of releasing code into production.
    - Agile methodology is the backbone of DevOps and it's a role that can bring the most positive impact to a team when you're at the core of both teams.
    **Culture benefits:**
    - Mould and create a company culture that is built on communication, trust and collaboration.
