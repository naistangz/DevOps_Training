## Agile Terminology 

## 3 amigos aka *Specification Workshop*
- A strategy to examine an increment (sum of all Product Backlog items completed during a Spring) of work before (**business**), during(**development**), and after development (**testing**).
- Business (BA, Product Owner)
- Development (Developer)
- Testing (Tester)

The **three** amigos ensures a common understanding for a story in the team. They go over **each* story in an informal session to give a shared vision of what will be delivered and helps ensure that it is the voice of the team rather than a single opinion. 

Promotes understanding of:
1. Collaborative requirements - What problem are we trying to solve
2. Ready for development consensus - How might we build a solution to solve that problem
3. Acceptance for [*Definition of Done*](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/scrum/definition-of-done-vs-acceptance-criteria/) - What is needed to get the story into 'Done'

## Persona
Extracted from [Nicholas Muldoon](https://blog.easyagile.com/customer-personas-how-to-write-them-and-why-you-need-them-in-agile-software-development-3873f3525975)
- Fictional generalisation of your most valuable customers.
- They help teams understand customers by bringing together demographic information like **age**, **gender**, **location**, and **income**, alongside **psychographic** information like **interests**, **frustrations** and **personal/professional motivations.**
- They are important to help identify customer needs and wants
- Personas provide a *face* to the user story

**Example: Customer Persona**

Building customer personas help teams to address the following questions:
1. Who are our customers?
2. What are their common behavioural patterns?
3. What are their shared pain points (professional and personal)?
4. What are their universal goals/objectives?
5. What drives them to make purchasing decisions?
6. Is the customer the buyer/decision maker?

## Information Radiators aka Big Visible Chart (BVC)
- A large graphical representation of project **information** kept plainly in sight within an **agile** development team's workspace. 
**Expected Benefits**
- The team has nothing to hide from its visitors (customers, stakeholders...)
- The team has nothing to hide from itself: it acknowledges and confronts problems
- BVC promotes responsibility among the team members. 
- The information radiators tend to provoke conversation when outsiders visit...which can yield useful ideas. 
 
 ## Scrum Artifacts
 - [Product Backlog](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-artifacts/#product): features of product you're developing
 - [Spring Backlog](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-artifacts/#sprint): describes what team members should develop during a sprint
 - [Product Increment](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-artifacts/#increment): the product version delivered after each sprint to the stakeholder
 - These are elements that help the team share vital project information with everyone involved. 
 For example:
  - How the project is progressing
  - What activities are planned for the upcoming sprint 
  - What has been completed so far. 
 
 
## Scrum events
There are **5** Scrum events in a **Scrum Process**:
- They are meetings that help teams discuss the development processes.
1. Sprint planning 
2. Daily scrum meeting
3. Spring review
4. Spring retrospective meeting

## Scrum Roles

## User Story 
1. General explanation of a software feature 
2. They typically follow a simple template: As a < type of **user** >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >

## CV Qs
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Branch of AI, deals with interaction between computers and humans the using the **natural language**.
    - Objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable
    - Increase in non-English internet users, non-Western centric developments in global business, increasing demand for translation between many new language pairs (Swahili - Chinese)
    - Cloud-based machine translation to drive cost of enterprise translation
    - Increased demand in localisation services (tech and processes that adapt products and services for use in and by specific countries, regions, groups)
- Will AI replace translators?
    - Current language translation technologies rely on leveraging a massive corpora of already-translated materials to learn translation models


- Why DevOps?
Why Devops
- Wanted to work in software development, build products, develop set skills that require problem solving, creativity and working in collaborative team. 
- Came across youtuber, a software developer who introduced what DevOps was. 
- Read article = growth of adoption of DevOps increased exponentially, considering the philosophy is only a decade long 

working in software development, the prospect of building products and programming sounded very challenging and creative and something, other industries such as law didn’t offer however reading about how devops adoption has increased bifold, it’s only a decade long, I thought going into devops was important so that I also get an understanding of the operations team. I think in devops you wear multiple hats, it’s interdisciplinary, it’s not a role but a culture helps me to better understand how to scale projects or programs as efficiently as possible. 

and having an understanding of how we can work with ops (network infrastructure_would help me to become a better software developer or employee

IT ops - hardware and network configuration/deployment/ security and access administration. ops deal with pipeline of releases 

Skills shared with dev = application deployment, infrastructure monitoring, database design and administration, service level management and reporting

Ops and Dev only interact during releases (Dev know about release date to insert a new feature,  ops team know whether the current release contains any new features) Ops do testing and test stability of release before deploayed at customer site. - Both strive towards goal of making a customer happy. 
Ops wants customers to use a stable tested system, sceptic to periodic upgrades with new features, development want to overwhelm the customers with new enhancements (e.g new payment feature)

Dev

## Birth of DevOps
- Patrick Debois, who identified bottlenecks e.g. continuous delviery or monitoring from the ops side which was an opportunity to open dialogue for increased automation or frequent releases with more interaction between ops and dev)


scrum roles, sprint review and sprint retrospective, Starfish retrospective, Root cause Analysis-part of retrospective, agile vales and principles. There are many more things in agile and scrum for which resources have been provided and you have done it practically like user story, epic etc. Have a solid answer ready for what is Agile?
