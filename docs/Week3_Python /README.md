## **Terminology**

**Dictionary**
- An unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map
- Dictionary holds key:value pair
- Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimised
- We use curly brackets {} to create a dictionary, separated by 'comma'
- Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys cannot be repeated and must be immutable

```python
student_record = {
    "name": "Anais",
    "stream": "DevOps",
    "completed_lesson": 5,
    "completed_lesson_names": ["Business Skills", "SQL", "Python"]
}
```

**Tuple**
- They are the same as lists but immutable meaning they cannot be changed
- Tuples use parenthesis ()

```python
dob = ("name", "dob", "passport number")
print(dob)
```

**List**
- A data structure that is mutable, or changeable.
- Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item.
- Lists are defined by having values between square brackets []

```python
cities = ["Paris", "Hong Kong", "Buenos Aires", "London,", "Tel Aviv", "Amsterdam"]
print(cities)
```
