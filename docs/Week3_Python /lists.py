# Data Collection

# In python, lists are same as arrays
# Java arrays in python lists are the same as arrays
# Why List? - Manage data - access data in order - it gives
# us the option to add, remove etc.

# Syntax of list: [list] square brackets (tuple) {dictionary - key:value}
# Tuples are immutable

# Let's create a list
cities = ["Tokyo", "Paris", "Prague", "Luxembourg", "Buenos Aires"]

# display refers to (print())
print(cities)
print(type(cities)) # returns 'List'
