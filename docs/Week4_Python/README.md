## Terminology

**HTTP(Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**
- Foundation of WWW, used to load web pages using hypertext links.
- HTTP is an application layer **protocol** designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack
- A typical flow over HTTP involves a client machines making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

---

**JSON(Javascript Object Notation)**
- Based on a subset of JavaScript language, it is a data storage language, similar to XML but adopts a 'dictionary' style syntax
- It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g. sending data from server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web)

Example of JSON object
```json
{
  "first_name" : "Bob",
  "last_name" : "Shark",
  "location" : "Ocean",
  "online" : true,
  "no_friends" : 987
}
```
