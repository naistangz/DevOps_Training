# TDD - Test Driven Development 

## What is TDD?
- TDD is the process of developing and running automated test before actual development of the applicaition.
- Sometimes called **Test First Development**


## Why do we use TDD?

## Benefits of using TDD
* **Early bug notification**
    - Developers can test their code but in the database world, this often consists of manual tests or one-off scripts.
    - Using TDD, you can build up, over time, a suite of automated tests that you and other developers can rerun.

* **Better Designed, cleaner and more extensible code**
    - Helps to understand how the code will be used and how it interacts with other modules
