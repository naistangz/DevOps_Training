1. Services delivered on demand over the Internet.
2. Services designed to provide access to compute resources and applications without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.
3. There is no need for a company to host the applications because cloud services are fully managed by cloud computing vendors (Azure, Google, AWS, IBM Cloud)

## Benefits of cloud services
1. Ability to scale, easy access to infrastructure and software
2. Affordability, no need for company to invest its own resources or allocate extra IT staff to manage the service.
3. Flexibility. Companies can procure services on an on-demand, as-needed basis. When a business no longer needs a platform, the business can simply cancel the subscription.
