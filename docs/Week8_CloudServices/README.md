# Cloud Services :cloud:

> Navigate [here](aws.md) for AWS Cloud Services

1. Services delivered on demand over the Internet.
2. Services designed to provide access to compute resources and applications without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware.
3. There is no need for a company to host the applications because cloud services are fully managed by cloud computing vendors (Azure, Google, AWS, IBM Cloud)

## Benefits of cloud services
1. Ability to scale, easy access to infrastructure and software
2. Affordability, no need for company to invest its own resources or allocate extra IT staff to manage the service.
3. Flexibility. Companies can procure services on an on-demand, as-needed basis. When a business no longer needs a platform, the business can simply cancel the subscription. 

## Types of cloud services
1. Software as a Service 
    - File storage
    - Backup
    - Web-based email
    - Project management tools 
    e.g Dropbox
2. Infrastructure as a Service
    - Load balancing
    - Application firewalls
    e.g (AWS, Azure, GCE)
3. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    - Web-based environment where developers can build cloud apps
    
## Hybrid Cloud :computer: :cloud:
> Extracted from [Netapp](https://www.netapp.com/us/info/what-is-hybrid-cloud.aspx#:~:text=Hybrid%20cloud%20refers%20to%20a,orchestration%20among%20the%20various%20platforms.)
- Mixed computing, storage, services environment made up of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud - e.g AWS, Microsoft Azure, GCE
- Using combination of public clouds, on-premises computing, and private clouds in data center means that you have a hybrid cloud infrastructure.    

## Hybrid Cloud Benefits
- Cloud services can drive cost savings, but main value lies in supporting fast-moving digital business transformation.
- Primary benefit is agility. The need to adapt and change direction quickly
- Enterprises may need to combine public clouds, private clouds, on premise resources to gain agility for competitive advantage.
- Hybrid allows apps and components to interoperate across boundaries, between cloud instances, having this flexibility means businesses are able to move to different data centers according to business changes e.g the applications or data that sits live in cloud or on premise today might not be best place for them to live over time.

## Hybrid Cloud characteristics
- On-premises data centre, private and cloud resources, workloads tied together under common data management
- Can connect existing systems running on traditional architectures that run business-critical applications or contain sensitive data that might be suited for public cloud.
