>	SCRUM Artefacts and Events
	What is scrum?
	w Framework that emphasises teamwork, accountability, iterative progress towards defined goal 
	w Scrum suited for projects with rapidly changing or highly emergent requirements
	w Like rugby team, scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organise while working on problem, reflect on wins and losses to continuously improve
	What is a sprint?
	w Short, time-boxed period when scrum team works to complete a set amount of work (30 days) e.g from day 0 to day 30 sprint planning, present product backlog items from highest priority to lowest, day 28 software implementation, hold meeting to check if implementation meets expectations before moving to sprint 2. 
	What are scrum artefacts?
	w They are key information that SCRUM TEAM and stakeholders need to be aware of for understanding the product under development
	w Artifact = object made by human, something we make, a tool that solves problem, art that inspires us.
Three primary artifacts (not limited to): product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment

> Product Backlog - prioritised list of work for development team. Most important items shown at top of product backlog so team knows what to deliver first. E.g features, functions, requirements, enhancements, fixes. Attributes: description, order, estimate, value 
>
>Sprint Backlog - list of tasks to be completed during a scrum sprint, team selects a number of product backlog items and identifies tasks necessary to complete user story ( a description of software feature from end user perspective, describes type of user, what they want and why, starting point to convo that establishes real product requirement)
>
>Product Increment - Sum of product backlog items completed during spring and value of increments of all previous springs. At end of spring, new increment must be working product aka useable condition. Must be in working condition regardless of whether product owner decides to release it.
